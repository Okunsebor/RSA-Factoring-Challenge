RSA Factoring Algorithm
This repository contains a solution to the RSA Factoring Algorithm Challenge. The goal of the challenge is to factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers using the RSA principle.

Installation
This program is written in Python 3 and requires no external libraries. Simply clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/RSA-Factoring-Algorithm.git
Usage
To factorize a list of numbers, create a text file containing the numbers to factorize, one number per line. Then, run the program using the following command:

Copy code
python factors.py numbers.txt
Where numbers.txt is the path to your text file.

The program will output the factorization of each number in the file
n=p*q
Where n is the original number, and p and q are the two factors.

Limitations
The program will terminate after 5 seconds if it has not finished factorizing all the numbers in the input file.
